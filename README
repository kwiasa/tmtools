TMTOOLS
=======

Bunch of utilities to convert python dictionaries to TextMate and SublimeText
related property lists. The advantages of using python dictionaries over plain
JSON or YAML files are modularity, and the full power of a scripting language,
like variables, on-the-fly string generation or dictionary manipulations.
